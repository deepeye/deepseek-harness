## Summary

This package fills the brand slots - `sidebar.brand.mark`, `sidebar.brand.name`, and `conversation.hero.brand.mark` - with the official SmartFox Harness mark and name. It registers these occupants in every build; the SmartFox brand is the user-visible brand regardless of build profile, and `DSH_CLIENT_BUILD_PROFILE` remains build-record provenance only. Choose this package when the deployed identity is SmartFox's own; a deployment with its own brand composes a different package into the same slots instead. It retains no runtime state and contributes nothing to model requests.

## Use this package

Mount this plugin in the browser roster of a deployment whose identity is SmartFox's own; the occupants register in every build, so no profile selection is required.

### Choosing the profile

The SmartFox brand renders in every build profile. `DSH_CLIENT_BUILD_PROFILE` and `DSH_CLIENT_COMMIT_HASH` remain build-record provenance for official artifacts; no client code reads either variable for presentation, so local and official builds render the identical brand.

### Replacing the brand

A deployment with its own identity leaves this package out and composes another package that occupies the same slots. Occupying a slot is the only composition route; there is no brand configuration surface here.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals - click to expand</summary>

The three occupants install as one declaration-aware registration set: nested `ctx.slots.inject()` calls wait on the sidebar and conversation declarations, so the set works whether this row activates before or after the declarers, withdraws all occupants when either declaration collapses, and leaves no partial brand mix during HMR. The browser half is [`src/client/index.ts`](src/client/index.ts); the node half is an empty Loader seat. The browser title is a build-environment concern (`DSH_CLIENT_TITLE`), outside the slot system.

## Further Exploration

Read these pages when the brand surface is not enough. They move from the slots this package occupies to the shell that renders them.

- [ui-sidebar](../ui-sidebar/README.md) - declares `sidebar.brand.mark` and `sidebar.brand.name` and renders their fallbacks.
- [ui-conversation](../ui-conversation/README.md) - declares `conversation.hero.brand.mark` in the hero.
- [Web client architecture](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-19-gui-web-client-architecture.md) - how browser plugin rows load and register slots.

## Model Experience

None, as the package contributes browser presentation only; nothing here reaches a model request.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define how brand presentation is supplied. They are current package constraints, not a brand-design comparison or a task backlog.

- **One occupant set** - alternative presentation belongs in another Cordis package occupying the same slots.
- **The browser title is independent** - `DSH_CLIENT_TITLE` selects title text at build time rather than through a UI slot.
